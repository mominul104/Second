**What is single channel:** If a system has one server which are service in one by one that is called single channel.<br>
In this problem we are try to solve find arrival time from inter arrival time.<br>
Now we have to known that what is inter arrival time and what is arrival time.<br>
**Inter arrival time:** At that point the customer is coming into the system<br>
**Arrival time:** At that point the customer started working.<br>
**Now solve this problem**<br>
We know that first customer has to arrive at 0 second so first customer inter arrival time and arrival time are 0.<br>
**Firstly** the inter arrival time for 19 customers has to be taken randomly. After taking randomly, it is printed.<br>
**Secondly** the following formula has to be used to determine the arrival time.<br>
*Present arrival time = Previous arrival time + present inter arrival time.*<br>
**Finaly** Thus, the arrival time for 20 customers was determined and displayed.
